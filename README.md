# Welcome to IGV
This document is going to go serve as an introduction to IGV, including how to set it up, the major features of the program, and how to idenify differrent variants, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small variants from 2-50 bases (indels), and larger structural variants of at least 50 bases (SVs). There will also be examples and questions along the way to help this information sink in. 

For this tutorials a few peices of setup are required. First, the desktop apllications for nIGV can be downloaded [here](https://igv.org/doc/desktop/#DownloadPage/). You will have to select the right version of the application for your computer (Mac, PC, etc). Second, we will be using five files throughout this tutorial. These files can be found at `/storage1/fs1/jin810/Active/testing/Ruttenberg/IGV_Tutorial`. The five files are
- proband bam
- father bam
- mother bam
- list of SNVs and indels in the proband
- list of SVs in the proband
  
After conferming you have access to these files and have downloaded IGV continue on to the rest of the tutorial
